## Abstract
Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in the judicial system. Despite its benefits, it has been shown that algorithms can contain biases against certain demographic groups, which often come from biased training data. In this project, we present an approach to evaluate a legal dataset concerning child custody sentences in Spain in terms of gender bias. We explore the data and analyse the effects of gender using several techniques. We find differences between the victory rates and arguments used by the court depending on the plaintiff gender, for which we have possible explanations that would discard gender biases. However, we find clear patterns in the winning probability depending on the judge gender, for which we do not find plausible explanations. Hence, some gender bias could be present. Our approach can be applied to other dataset fairness assessments and the results can also serve as a starting point for further analysis on this particular dataset.

## Organization
The project is organized in three main folders:
* `data`: contains the main legal dataset and some support datasets used throughout the code.
* `src`: contains the main notebook as well as the modules folder containing all the organized code for each section.
* `output`: contains partial outputs generated throughout the code.
